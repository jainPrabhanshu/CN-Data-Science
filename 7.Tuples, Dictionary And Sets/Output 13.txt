What will be the output of following code?
s = {1,2,3,5,4,2,3,1}
print(len(s),end= “ “)
s.add(4)
s.add(3)
print(len(s))


answer  -  5 5

Solution Description
The elements in a set cannot be repeated i.e. an element can occur only once.

s = {1,2,3,5,4,2,3,1} outputs {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

When s.add(4) is called firstly it checks if 4 is already present and if not present then only adds it to the set. Same for s.add(3)

Final output is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
