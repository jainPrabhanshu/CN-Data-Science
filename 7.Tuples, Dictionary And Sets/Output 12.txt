What will be the output of following code?
a = {1:2,’list’:[1,2],3:5}
a.pop(‘list’)
a[‘list’] = [3,5]
print(a[‘list’])


answer  -  [3,5]

Solution Description
In order to delete an entry corresponding to any key in a dictionary, we can simply pop the key from the dictionary. The method used here is .pop(). This method removes the key-value pair corresponding to any particular key and then returns the value of the removed key-value pair.

In this case, when a.pop(‘list’) is called it removed the key 'list' from a. And when 
a[‘list’] = [3,5] is called it added another key named 'list'.

The output for print(a[‘list’]) is [3, 5].
