What will be the output of following code?
d = {1:2, “abc”:5, “def”:7}
print(d.get(0,5))

We can make use of this feature in another way. Say we want the method to do the following action: If the key is present in the dictionary then return the value corresponding to the key. In case the key is not present, return a custom desired value ( say 0 ).
