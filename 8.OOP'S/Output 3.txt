What will be the output of following code?
class Student:

    def __init__(self,name,age):
        self.name = “Rohan”
        self.age = 20

    def print_student_details():
        print(self.name, end= “ “)
        print(self.age)


s = Student()
s.print_student_details()

answer  -  error

Once you create an object of the Student class, it also expects two arguments i.e one for name and one for age. But in this code no argument is passed while creating an object of the Student class, hence it will throw an erro
