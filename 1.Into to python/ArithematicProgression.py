# You are given first three entries of an arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the common difference and print it.
# Input format:
# The first line of input contains an integer a (1 <= a <= 100)
# The second line of input contains an integer b (1 <= b <= 100) 
# The third line of input contains an integer c (1 <= c <= 100) 
# Constraints:
# Time Limit: 1 second
# Output format:
# The first and only line of output contains the result.  
# Sample Input:
# 1
# 3
# 5
# Sample Output:
# 2

# Write your code here
a1 = int(input())
a2 = int(input())
a3 = int(input())
print(a2-a1)
